# Goal

  1. Create a learning language model that can take an image of a dog and predict the correct breed of dog.

  2. Create a simple summary of the dog breed.

  3. Use this project to explore torch, torchvision, and other related libraries, including huggingface

  4. Explore and utilize existing image databases on sites like Kaggle

  5. Automate the process of downloading the data set and cleaning the data if necessary.

  6. Explore how decreasing learning rate, increasing epochs, and different pretrained models affect performance, memory usage

  7. Push the project into a repository and build a simple full-stack application based on the model

# Project Status

  * The project has mostly been completed by successfully training a model using the Efficient_B2 pretrained model using a learning rate of 0.0001 and 9 epochs.

  * The quality of the dataset could be better, and as a result, the accuracy, especially during the test phase, will rarely rise above 80 percent.

  * The model has been consumed by a full-stack application built by me
